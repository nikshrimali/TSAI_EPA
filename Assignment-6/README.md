# Assignment 6

## Problem Statement

- Write a single expression that includes lambda, zip and map functions to select create 52 cards in a deck - 50 pts
- Write a normal function without using lambda, zip, and map function to create 52 cards in a deck - 50 pts
- Write a function that, when given 2 sets of 3 or 4 or 5 cards (1 game can only have 3 cards with each player or 4 cards or 5 cards per player) (1 deck of cards only), (2 players only), can identify who won the game of poker 

## Target

- Basics (applicable to 2/3 above):
- Proper readme file - 50 (if not there then 0)
- Docstrings must, and it must mention what the function is doing (2, 3) - 50
- Write annotations for 3 - 50 pts
- Basics tests to ensure your code if correct (20+ combination tests (counted as 1 test) in 3, check 1/2 with a manual list of 52 cards. Overall 20 tests at minimum) - 200 pts
- Submit Github link with all test files and github actions in place. 


#  Functions Implemented 

## get_player_score(a:list) -> dict
    Checks the cards, identifies and computes a score of user's deck

## get_my_deck_normally
    Returns a deck of 52 cards when function is called using normal string

## kinda_poker(a:list, b:list) -> list
    Checks the type of cards and computes a score to predict who wins

## get_deck_oneline()
    single expression that includes lambda, zip and map functions to select create 52 cards in a deck

# Algorithm for Poker

 > Never played poker before, hence mentioning my understanding of the game which explains the logic of code

- Player who has superior cards wins the round
- Player can have 3,4,5 cards
- Both players should have same no of cards when comparing
- Winning priority is as per the image above from Ranks 1 - 10

    - Rank_1 - Royal Flush - All the big cards consequitively of same suits
    - Rank_2 - Straight Flush - All cards consequitively of same suits
    - Rank_3 - Four of a Kind - All the same vals cards but of different suits. Valid only when you have 4 or 5 cards
    - Rank_4 - Full House - A Triplet and a duplet of same vals but with different suits
    - Rank_5 - Flush - All the cards of same suits
    - Rank_6 - Straight - All the cards consequitively but of differnt suits
    - Rank_7 - Three of a Kind - Triplets of cards with same vals but different suits
    - Rank_8 - Two Pair - 2 Duplets of cards with same vals, but different suits
    - Rank_9 - One Pair -  1 Duplet of cards with same vals, but different suits
    - Rank_10 - High Card  - Cards which matches none of any above matching patterns :P
