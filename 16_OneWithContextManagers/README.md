## Goal 1
Create a lazy iterator that will return a named tuple of the data in each row. The data types should be appropriate - i.e. if the column is a date, you should be storing dates in the named tuple, if the field is an integer, then it should be stored as an integer, etc.

## Goal 2
Calculate the number of violations by car make.
