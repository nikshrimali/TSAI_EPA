# Assignment 7

## Problem Statement

- Write a function using only list filter lambda that can tell whether a number is a Fibonacci number or not. You can use a pre-calculated list/dict to store fab numbers till 10000 PTS:100
- Using list comprehension (and zip/lambda/etc if required) write an expression that: PTS:100
- add 2 iterables a and b such that a is even and b is odd
- strips every vowel from a string provided (tsai>>t s)
- acts like a ReLU function for a 1D array
- acts like a sigmoid function for a 1D array
- takes a small character string and shifts all characters by 5 (handle boundary conditions) tsai>>yxfn
- A list comprehension expression that takes a ~200 word paragraph, and checks whether it has any of the swear words mentioned in https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words/blob/master/list.txt PTS:200 (Links to an external site.)
Using reduce function: PTS:100
- add only even numbers in a list
- find the biggest character in a string (printable ascii characters)
- adds every 3rd number in a list
- Using randint, random.choice and list comprehensions, write an expression that generates 15 random KADDAADDDD number plates, where KA is fixed, D stands for a digit, and A stands for Capital alphabets. 10<<DD<<99 & 1000<<DDDD<<9999 PTS:100
- Write the above again from scratch where KA can be changed to DL, and 1000/9999 ranges can be provided. Now use a partial function such that 1000/9999 are hardcoded, but KA can be provided PTS:100
